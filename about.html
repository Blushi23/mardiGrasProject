            <h2>━ Mardi Gras in New-Orleans ━</h2>
            <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in southern Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                Celebrations are
                concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the
                start of lent in
                the Western Christian tradition). Mardi Gras is French for Fat Tuesday, but the season actually begins
                on King’s Day
                (12th Night), January 6th, and extends until midnight before Ash Wednesday. Club, or Krewe, balls start
                soon after,
                though most are extremely private, with their Kings and Queens coming from wealthy old families and
                their courts
                consisting of the season’s debutantes. Most of the high society Krewes do not stage parades. As Fat
                Tuesday gets nearer,
                the parades start in earnest. Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days
                have several
                large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras
                season. In the
                final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and
                balls (some of
                them masquerade balls).</p>
            <p>
                The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
                schedule and route
                each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
                Knights of Momus and
                the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events
                (often featuring
                celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social Aid &
                Pleasure Club—a
                predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most
                common throws are
                strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", and small inexpensive
                toys. Major krewes
                follow the same parade schedule and route each year.</p>
            <p>
                While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate
                in the Uptown and
                Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of
                the French
                Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and 'tit Rex - also take place downtown in
                the Faubourg
                Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day traditionally
                concludes with the
                "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>
            <h2>━ History ━</h2>
            <p>The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville,
                and their men celebrated it
                as part of an
                observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is
                unknown. A 1730
                account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including
                cross-dressing).
                An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing
                of masks in the
                streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed
                whenever such
                restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.

                In 1833, Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent raised money
                to fund an
                official Mardi Gras celebration. James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other
                Miscellaneous Pieces
                describes New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835.</p>
            <p>Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun,
                frolic, and comic
                masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and boys,
                women and
                girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear in
                grotesque, quizzical,
                diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds,
                beasts and birds
                with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from
                the moon;
                mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts,
                coaches, cars,
                &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling,
                fifeing, and
                all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.</p>
            <p>In 1856, 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to
                observe Mardi Gras
                with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mistick Krewe of Comus.
                According to one
                historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what New Orleans had always considered
                a French
                festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday had
                passed from
                French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and
                its Creoles. To a
                certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of
                how their business
                prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized
                Carnival passed from
                Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the nineteenth century.
                The spectacle of
                Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms
                and on the
                streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely American.
            </p>
            <p>In 1875, Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday. War, economic, political, and weather
                conditions
                sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American Civil War,
                World War I and
                World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.</p>
            <p>The 1898, Rex parade, with the theme of "Harvest Queens," was filmed by the American Mutoscope Co. The
                rumored but
                long-lost recording was rediscovered in 2022. The two-minute film records 6 parade floats, including one
                transporting a
                live ox. In December of 2022, the film was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically
                significant" by the
                National Film Registry by the Library of Congress</p>
            <h4>20th and 21th centuries</h4>
            <p>In 1979, the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or moved to
                surrounding
                communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came to the
                city. Masking,
                costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops maintaining order. Guardsmen
                prevented crimes
                against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating morality or drug use; for
                these reasons, some
                in the French Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.</p>
            <p>In 1991, the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including
                Mardi Gras
                Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or
                sexual orientation,
                to obtain parade permits and other public licenses. Shortly after the law was passed, the city
                demanded that these
                krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing traditions of secrecy and the
                distinctly
                private nature of these groups. In protest—and because the city claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction
                to demand
                otherwise-private membership lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading. Proteus
                did parade in
                the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in
                2000.</p>
            <p>Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two federal
                courts later
                declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights of free
                association, and an
                unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the ordinance. The US Supreme Court
                refused to hear
                the city's appeal from this decision.</p>
            <p>Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays dues,
                and any member
                can have a place on a parade float.</p>
            <h2>━ Traditional colors ━</h2>
            <p>The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are purple, green, and gold. The
                colors were first
                specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their inaugural parade in 1872,
                suggesting that
                balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were chosen;
                some accounts
                suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true
                symbolism.</p>
            <p>Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three
                colors in that
                order symbolized justice, power, and faith. Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of
                the Rex
                Organization, presented a theory that the colors were based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to
                a heraldic
                tincture, and Rex's goal may have been to create a tricolor to represent their "kingdom". Purple was
                widely associated
                with royalty, while white was already heavily used on other national flags, and was thus avoided.
                Furthermore, he noted
                that a flag in green, gold and purple in that order complies with the rule of tincture, which states
                that metals (gold
                or silver) can only be placed on or next to other colors, and that colors cannot be placed on or next to
                other
                colors. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as purple, green, and gold, in that order—even
                though this
                order technically violates the rule of tincture.</p>
            <h2>━ Contemporary Mardi Gras ━</h2>
            <h4>Epiphany</h4>
            <p>Epiphany on January 6, has been recognized as the start of the New Orleans Carnival season since at least
                1900; locally,
                it is sometimes known as Twelfth Night although this term properly refers to Epiphany Eve, January 5,
                the evening of the
                twelfth day of Christmastide. The Twelfth Night Revelers, New Orleans' second-oldest Krewe, have staged
                a parade and
                masked ball on this date since 1870. A number of other groups such as the Phunny Phorty Phellows, La
                Société Pas Si
                Secrète Des Champs-Élysées and the Krewe de Jeanne D'Arc have more recently begun to stage events on
                Epiphany as well.</p>
            <p>Many of Carnival's oldest societies, such as the Independent Strikers' Society, hold masked balls but no
                longer parade
                in public.

                Mardi Gras season continues through Shrove Tuesday or Fat Tuesday.</p>
            <h4>Days leading up to Mardi Gras Day</h4>
            <p>A 2020 study estimated that Mardi Gras brings 1.4 million visitors to New Orleans.</p>
            <p>Wednesday night begins with Druids, and is followed by the Mystic Krewe of Nyx, the newest all-female
                Krewe. Nyx is
                famous for their highly decorated purses, and has reached Super Krewe status since their founding in
                2011.</p>
            <p>Thursday night starts off with another all-women's parade featuring the Krewe of Muses. The parade is
                relatively new,
                but its membership has tripled since its start in 2001. It is popular for its throws (highly
                sought-after decorated
                shoes and other trinkets) and themes poking fun at politicians and celebrities.</p>
            <p>Friday night is the occasion of the large Krewe of Hermes and satirical Krewe D'État parades, ending with
                one of the
                fastest-growing krewes, the Krewe of Morpheus. There are several smaller neighborhood parades like the
                Krewe of
                Barkus and the Krewe of OAK.</p>
            <p>Several daytime parades roll on Saturday (including Krewe of Tucks and Krewe of Isis) and on Sunday
                (Thoth, Okeanos, and
                Krewe of Mid-City).</p>
            <p>The first of the "super krewes," Endymion, parades on Saturday night, with the celebrity-led Bacchus
                parade on Sunday
                night.</p>
            <h4>Mardi Gras day</h4>
            <p>The celebrations begin early on Mardi Gras Day, which can fall on any Tuesday between February 3 and
                March 9 (depending
                on the date of Easter, and thus of Ash Wednesday).</p>
            <p>In New Orleans, the Zulu parade rolls first, starting at 8 am on the corner of Jackson and Claiborne and
                ending at Broad
                and Orleans, Rex follows Zulu as it turns onto St. Charles following the traditional Uptown route from
                Napoleon to St.
                Charles and then to Canal St. Truck parades follow Rex and often have hundreds of floats blowing loud
                horns, with entire
                families riding and throwing much more than just the traditional beads and doubloons. Numerous smaller
                parades and
                walking clubs also parade around the city. The Jefferson City Buzzards, the Lyons Club, the Irish
                Channel Corner Club,
                Pete Fountain's Half Fast Walking Club and the KOE all start early in the day Uptown and make their way
                to the French
                Quarter with at least one jazz band. At the other end of the old city, the Society of Saint Anne
                journeys from the
                Bywater through Marigny and the French Quarter to meet Rex on Canal Street. The Pair-O-Dice Tumblers
                rambles from bar to
                bar in Marigny and the French Quarter from noon to dusk. Various groups of Mardi Gras Indians, divided
                into uptown and
                downtown tribes, parade in their finery.</p>
            <h2>━ Cosutmes and Masks ━</h2>
            <p>In New Orleans, costumes and masks are seldom publicly worn by non-Krewe members on the days before Fat
                Tuesday (other
                than at parties), but are frequently worn on Mardi Gras. Laws against concealing one's identity with a
                mask are
                suspended for the day. Banks are closed, and some businesses and other places with security concerns
                (such as
                convenience stores) post signs asking people to remove their masks before entering.</p>
            <h2>━ Throws ━</h2>
            <p>A 'throw' is the collective term used for the objects that are thrown from floats to parade-goers. Until
                the 1960s, the
                most common form was multi-colored strings of glass beads made in Czechoslovakia.</p>
            <p>Glass beads were supplanted by less expensive and more durable plastic beads, first from Hong Kong, then
                from Taiwan,
                and more recently from China. Lower-cost beads and toys allow float-riders to purchase greater
                quantities, and throws
                have become more numerous and common.</p>
            <p>In the 1990s, many people lost interest in small, cheap beads, often leaving them where they landed on
                the ground.
                Larger, more elaborate metallic beads and strands with figures of animals, people, or other objects have
                become the
                sought-after throws. David Redmond's 2005 film of cultural and economic globalization, Mardi Gras: Made
                in China,
                follows the production and distribution of beads from a small factory in Fuzhou, China to the streets of
                New Orleans
                during Carnival. The publication of Redmon's book, Beads, Bodies, and Trash: Public Sex, Global Labor,
                and the
                Disposability of Mardi Gras, follows up on the documentary by providing an ethnographic analysis of the
                social harms,
                the pleasures, and the consequences of the toxicity that Mardi Gras beads produce</p>
            <p>In addition to the toxicity of tons of plastic, eye injuries from Mardi Gras parade throws are
                commonplace, and more
                severe injuries—such as a fractured skull in an infant struck by a coconut—have also been known to
                occur.</p>
            <h2>━ Other Mardi Gras traditions ━</h2>
            <h4>Social clubs</h4>
            <p>New Orleans Social clubs play a very large part in the Mardi Gras celebration as hosts of many of the
                parades on or
                around Mardi Gras. The two main Mardi Gras parades, Zulu and Rex, are both social club parades. Zulu is
                a mostly
                African-American club and Rex is mostly Caucasian. Social clubs host Mardi Gras balls, starting in late
                January. At
                these social balls, the queen of the parade (usually a young woman between the ages of 18 and 21, not
                married and in
                high school or college) and the king (an older male member of the club) present themselves and their
                court of maids
                (young women aged 16 to 21), and different divisions of younger children with small roles in the ball
                and parade, such
                as a theme-beformal neighborhood Carnival club ball at local bar room.</p>
            <p>After their exclusion from Rex, in 1909 Black Creole and other African American New Orleanians, led by a
                mutual aid
                group known as "The Tramps", adorned William Storey with a tin can crown and banana stalk scepter and
                named him King
                Zulu. This display was meant as a mockery of Rex's overstated pageantry but in time, Zulu became a grand
                parade
                in its own right. By 1949, as an indication of Zulu's increase in prestige, the krewe named New Orleans'
                native son
                Louis Armstrong as its king.</p>
            <p>Being a member of the court requires much preparation, usually months ahead. Women and girls must have
                dress fittings as
                early as the May before the parade, as the season of social balls allows little time between each
                parade. These balls
                are generally by invitation only. Balls are held at a variety of venues in the city, large and small,
                depending on the
                size and budget of the organization. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the French Opera House was
                a leading venue
                for New Orleans balls. From the mid 20th century until Hurricane Katrina the Municipal Auditorim was the
                city's most
                famous site for Carnival balls. In more recent years, most are at the ballrooms of various hotels
                throughout the city.
                The largest "Super Krewes" use larger venues; Bacchus the Morial Convention Center and Endymion the
                Superdome.</p>
            <h4>Doubloons</h4>
            <p>One of the many Mardi Gras throws which krewes fling into the crowds, doubloons are large coins, either
                wood or metal,
                made in Mardi Gras colors. Artist H. Alvin Sharpe created the modern doubloon for The School of Design
                (the actual name
                of the Rex organization). According to the krewe history, in January 1959 Sharpe arrived at the offices
                of the captain
                of the krewe with a handful of aluminum discs. Upon entering the office, he threw the doubloons into the
                captain's face
                to prove that they would be safe to throw from the floats. Standard krewe doubloons usually portray the
                Krewe's emblem,
                name, and founding date on one side, and the theme and year of the parade and ball on the other side.
                Royalty and
                members of the court may throw specialty doubloons, such as the special Riding Lieutenant doubloons
                given out by men on
                horseback in the Rex parade. In the last decade, krewes have minted doubloons specific to each float.
                Krewes also mint
                special doubloons of cloisonné or pure silver for its members. They never throw these from the floats.
                Original Rex
                doubloons are valuable, but it is nearly impossible for aficionados to find a certified original
                doubloon. The School of
                Design did not begin dating their doubloons until a few years after their introduction.</p>
            <h4>Flambeau carriers</h4>
            <p>The flambeau (pronounced "flahm-bo", meaning flame-torch) carrier originally, before electric lighting,
                served as a
                beacon for New Orleans parade goers to better enjoy the spectacle of night parades. The first flambeau
                carriers were
                slaves. Today, the flambeaux are a connection to the New Orleans version of Carnival and a valued
                contribution. Many
                people view flambeau-carrying as a kind of performance art – a valid assessment given the wild gyrations
                and flourishes
                displayed by experienced flambeau carriers in a parade. Many individuals are descended from a long line
                of carriers.
                Parades that commonly feature flambeaux include Babylon, Bacchus, Chaos, Le Krewe d'Etat, Druids,
                Endymion, Hermes,
                Krewe of Muses, Krewe of Orpheus, Krewe of Proteus, Saturn, and Sparta. Flambeaux are powered by
                naphtha, a highly flammable aromatic. It is a tradition, when the flambeau carriers pass by during a
                parade, to toss
                quarters to them in thanks for carrying the lights of Carnival. In the 21st century, though, handing
                dollar bills is
                common.</p>
            <h4>Rex</h4>
            <p>Each year in New Orleans, krewes are responsible for electing Rex, the king of the carnival. The Rex
                Organization
                was formed to create a daytime parade for the residents of the city. The Rex motto is, "Pro Bono
                Publico—for the public
                good".</p>
            <h4>New Orleans Zulu or Mardi Gras Coconut</h4>
            <p>One of the most famous and the most sought after throws, is the Zulu Coconut also known as the Golden
                Nugget and the
                Mardi Gras Coconut. The coconut is mentioned as far back as 1910, where they were given in a natural
                "hairy" state.
                The coconut was thrown as a cheap alternative, especially in 1910 when the bead throws were made of
                glass. Before the
                Krewe of Zulu threw coconuts, they threw walnuts that were painted gold. This is where the name "Golden
                Nugget"
                originally came from. It is thought that Zulu switched from walnuts to coconuts in the early 1920s when
                a local painter,
                Lloyd Lucus, started to paint coconuts. Most of the coconuts have two decorations. The first is painted
                gold with added
                glitter, and the second is painted like the famous black Zulu faces. In 1988, the city forbade Zulu from
                throwing
                coconuts due to the risk of injury; they are now handed to onlookers rather than thrown. In the year
                2000, a local
                electronics engineer, Willie Clark, introduced an upgraded version of the classic, naming them Mardi
                Gras Coconuts.
                These new coconuts were first used by the club in 2002, giving the souvenirs to royalty and city
                notables.</p>
            <h4>Ojen liqueur</h4>
            <p>Aguardiente de Ojén, or simply "ojen" ("OH-hen") as it is known in English, is a Spanish anisette
                traditionally
                consumed during the New Orleans Mardi Gras festivities. In Ojén, the original Spanish town where it is
                produced,
                production stopped for years, but it started again in early 2014 by means of the distillery company
                Dominique Mertens
                Impex. S.L.</p>
            <h4>House floats</h4>
            <p>In 2021 due to the cancellation of parades due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the practice of decorating homes
                in the style
                of parade floats emerged as an alternative, dubbed "home floats" or "house floats". The concept was
                popularized
                immediately after the announcement that in-person parades would be prohibited, stemming from a post on
                Twitter by Megan
                Boudreaux. She later established a formal "Krewe of House Floats", with participants being listed in an
                interactive map
                on its website so local residents can tour them. The revised celebration was nicknamed "Yardi Gras" by
                residents. Even the dog parade, held by the Mystic Krewe of Mardi Paws in Covington, opted to make "dog
                house
                floats' in 2021.</p>
            <h4>Public nudity</h4>
            <p>Wearing less clothing than considered decent in other contexts during Mardi Gras has been documented
                since 1889, when
                the Times-Democrat decried the "degree of immodesty exhibited by nearly all female masqueraders seen on
                the streets."
                Risqué costumes, including body painting, are fairly common. The practice of exposing female breasts in
                exchange for
                Mardi Gras beads, however, was mostly limited to tourists in the upper Bourbon Street area. In the
                crowded
                streets of the French Quarter, generally avoided by locals on Mardi Gras Day, flashers on balconies
                cause crowds to form
                on the streets.</p>
            <p>In the last decades of the 20th century, the rise in producing commercial videotapes catering to voyeurs
                helped
                encourage a tradition of women baring their breasts in exchange for beads and trinkets. Social
                scientists studying
                "ritual disrobement" found, at Mardi Gras 1991, 1,200 instances of body-baring in exchange for beads or
                other favors.</p>

            <h2> ━ About the mayor ━</h2>
            <p>LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New
                Orleans,
                Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office. Before becoming
                mayor, Cantrell
                represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.</p>
            <p>Cantrell lives with her husband Jason and daughter RayAnn in New Orleans.</p>

            <h3>Early life and education</h3>
            <p>Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier
                University of
                Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology. She attended an executive training program at the Harvard
                Kennedy
                School.</p>
            <h3>Political career</h3>
            <h4>New Orleans City Council
            </h4>
            <p>In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans City Council seat vacated when former
                District B
                representative Stacy Head won an election to an at-large position. After the November election,
                candidate Dana Kaplan
                and Cantrell advanced to a December runoff, which Cantrell won with 54 percent of the vote. Cantrell
                served out the
                balance of Head's term, and was unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014.</p>
            <p>As a council member, Cantrell focused on health, housing, and criminal-justice issues. She introduced a
                bill banning
                smoking at restaurants and bars within New Orleans, citing the health effects of secondhand smoke on
                service industry
                workers. The council unanimously passed the bill in 2015.</p>
            <p>Also in 2015, Cantrell began work to open a low-barrier homeless shelter, a move that was objected to by
                residents
                because of its proposed placement in Central City, New Orleans. Instead, the shelter was moved to the
                downtown site of
                the former VA Hospital. In 2017, Cantrell introduced legislation with at-large council member Jason
                Williams to
                register and inspect rental units in the city.</p>
            <p>As a member of the Criminal Justice Committee, Cantrell participated in efforts to install crime cameras
                in her
                district, assess the effectiveness of citywide anti-gun-violence campaigns, and address understaffing at
                the New Orleans
                Police Department.</p><br>
            <h4>2017 mayoral election
            </h4>
            <p>Cantrell declared her candidacy for mayor of New Orleans in March 2017 in a race to replace term-limited
                mayor Mitch
                Landrieu. An open primary was held on October 14 and included 18 candidates. Cantrell garnered the most
                votes,
                winning 39% of the total. In the November 18 runoff election, Cantrell defeated fellow Democratic
                opponent Desiree
                Charbonnet, a former municipal judge, with 60% of the vote. She is the first woman to lead New Orleans
                in its 300-year
                history, as well as the first mayor not born in the city since Vic Schiro.</p><br>
            <h4>Mayor of New Orleans </h4>
            <p>Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's
                history. Once
                in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a strategic
                plan to address
                families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with
                finding solutions to
                violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city use,
                Cantrell has
                focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation, public
                parks, and green
                spaces. As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four
                opioid
                manufacturers and distributors.</p>
            <p>During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share Agreement with
                Governor John
                Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million in upfront funding
                for the city's
                infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual recurring revenue for the city. Following the
                approval of the
                Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals Cantrell and the City Council put
                on the ballot
                in the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on short-term rental
                properties, as
                well the establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Awards</h4>
            <p>In 2016, Cantrell was given a lifetime achievement award by the presidents of Tulane, Loyola and Xavier
                universities and
                the University of New Orleans for her service to the community.</p><br>
            <h4>2021 mayor selection</h4>
            <p>Cantrell was re-elected to office by a wide margin in November 2021, securing 65% of the vote. Her
                campaign focused
                on the city's status in 2020 as a COVID-19 hotspot and her efforts, which at times were unpopular, to
                stop the disease's
                spread. She also stressed the need for higher-paying jobs for city workers, better public health
                outcomes and new
                technologies for the future of New Orleans.</p><br>
            <h4>Controversies</h4>
            <p>According to NOLA.com, Latoya was found to be using tax-payer funded credit cards for personal expenses.
                "New Orleans
                mayoral candidate LaToya Cantrell and her staff used her office's taxpayer-financed credit cards to
                cover almost $4,350
                in purchases she repaid from her campaign funds – sometimes years later, a review of her spending
                records show. Cantrell
                also charged to her City Council credit card $4,602 in meals and other expenses that she repaid with her
                own money after
                she entered the mayor's race".</p>
            <p>Also according to NOLA.com, several liens were filed against Latoya, due to her and/or her immediate
                family owing
                upwards of $95,000 in back taxes. "New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell owes more than $95,000 to the
                Internal Revenue
                Service for unpaid taxes over the course of six years, according to liens filed by the agency against
                her home in
                Broadmoor".</p>
            <p>In August 2022, a petition was filed to recall Mayor Cantrell by a political opponent and perennial
